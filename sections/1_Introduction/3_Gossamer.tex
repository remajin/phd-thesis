\section{Gossamer}

This work extends \trust{} to build a rack-wide programming model. \name{} aims to provide a high 
performance and easy to program in, framework that can take advantage of the increased resources that in a 
rack. Using the API provided by \name{} programmers will be able to code their applications 
like a normal delegation application with very few changes. Most of the distribution of work will be handled 
behind the scenes, but programmers will have the option to customize where the worker threads should run 
and where data should be held in the rack if they so choose.

One inherent problem that restricts performance in distributed settings is the higher latency caused by 
network traversal. \name{} overcomes that by using RDMA along with taking advantage of fibers. RDMA provides 
sub-micro second one way latency that is comparable to that of permanent storage on single machine. While 
RDMA solves the problem with high latency, it does not scale well with increasing number of connections per 
machine. To solve this \name{} establishes only one connection per hardware thread for each remote machine 
and uses many fibers to utilize the available throughput to full extent.

\name{} implements delegation in a way that applications will have the illusion of running on the same 
machine. This can be done by mapping the server memory to a client's address space using RDMA. This means 
that various things that are normally only possible in shared memory can be done in a distributed setting. 
Some examples include spawning a fiber, joining a fiber and accessing a shared object.
