\section{Dissertation Organization}

The remainder of this dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter~\ref{background} gives brief background on shared 
memory synchronization and distributed systems. Chapter~\ref{trust} introduces \trust{}, a delegation 
based programming abstraction that provides safe access to shared data. Chapter~\ref{gossamer} presents \name{}, 
an extension of \trust{}, that allows single-machine, multi-threaded applications built using \trust{}, to run on 
a rack consisting of many machines with minimal changes. Chapter~\ref{conclusion} discusses future work and provides 
a conclusion.
