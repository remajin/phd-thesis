\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we present \name{}, a delegation based distributed programming model. \name{} allows single 
machine applications using \trust{} to be distributed across a small rack with minimal changes to code. We take 
advantage of the fact that the same binary is run on all machines for a \name{} process to reduce the request 
size and lower network overhead. We also demonstrate that \name{} scales well. It can match the performance of a 
specialized benchmark despite being a general programming model, and it outperforms client sharded key value 
stores.
