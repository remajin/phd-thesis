The objective of \trust{} is to provide an intuitive API for safe, efficient access to shared objects. Naturally, our design motivation is to support delegation, but the \trust{} API can in principle also be implemented using locking, or a combination of locking and delegation. 
Below, we first introduce the basic \trust{} programming model, as well as the key terms {\it trust, property, trustee} and {\it fiber} in the \trust{} context, before digging deeper into the design of \trust{}. 


\subsection{Trust: a reference to an object}


A \trust{} is a thread-safe reference counting smart-pointer, similar to Rust's {\it Arc$<$T$>$}. 
To create a \trust{}, we clone an existing \trust{} or $entrust$ a new object, or $property$ of type $T$, that is meant to be shared between threads. 
Once entrusted, the property can only be accessed by {\it applying} closures to it, using a trust.
Table~\ref{tab:minimal} illustrates this through a minimal Rust example.
Line 1 entrusts an integer, initialized to 17, to the local trustee - the trustee fiber running on the current kernel thread. 
Line 2 applies an anonymous closure to the counter, via the trust.
The closure expected by {\tt apply} takes a mutable reference to the property as argument, allowing it unrestricted access to the property, in this case, our integer. 
The example closure increments the value of the integer. 
The assertion on line 3 is illustrative only. Here, we apply a second closure to retrieve the value of the
entrusted integer\footnote{A note on ownership: While the passed-in closure takes only a reference to the property, the Rust syntax $*c$ denotes an explicit dereference, essentially returning a copy of the property to the caller. This will pass compile-time type-checking only for types that implement $Copy$, such as integers.}.

\subsection{Trustee - a thread in charge of entrusted properties}

In our examples above, \trust{} is implemented using delegation. Here, a {\it property} is {\it entrusted} to a {\it trustee}, a designated thread which executes applied closures on behalf of other threads. 
In the default \trust{} runtime environment, every OS thread in use already has a trustee user-thread ({\it fiber}) that shares the thread with other fibers. When a fiber applies a closure to a trust, this is sent to the corresponding trustee as a message. Upon receipt, the trustee executes the closure on the property, and responds, including any closure return value. This may sound complex, yet the produced executable code %, the amount of work performed is similar to past delegation systems presented by XXXX \cite{xxx} and Roghanchi et. al. \cite{ffwd}, and 
substantially outperforms locking in congested settings.

A TrusteeReference API is also provided. Here, the most important function is {\tt entrust()}, which takes a property of type {\tt T} as argument (by value), and returns a \trust{} referencing the property that is now owned by the trustee. This API allows the programmer to manually manage the allocation of properties to trustees, for performance tuning or other purposes. Alternatively, a basic thread pool is provided to manage distribution of fibers and variables across trustees.% (see \S\ref{s:threadpool}). \na{Threadpool should be elaborated on a bit more somewhere.}


\subsection{Fiber - a delegation-aware, light-weight user thread}

While the \trust{} abstraction has some utility in isolation, it is most valuable when combined with an efficient message-passing implementation and a user-threading runtime. 
User-level threads, also known as coroutines or {\it fibers}, share a kernel thread, but each execute on their own stack, enabling a thread to do useful work for one fiber while another waits for a response from a trustee. This includes executing the local trustee fiber to service any incoming requests.

In this default setting, the synchronous {\tt apply()} function suspends the current fiber when it issues a request, scheduling the next fiber from the local ready queue to run instead. The local fiber scheduler will periodically poll for responses to outstanding requests, and resume suspended fibers as their blocking requests complete.

\subsection{Delegated context}
%In principle, much of this could be implemented with kernel threads, but in practice, a light-weight user threading implementation is both more efficient, and more practical as it allows us to run our own scheduler. 
For the purpose of future discussion, we define the term {\it delegated context} to mean the context where a delegated closure executes. Generally speaking, closures execute as part of a trustee fiber, on the trustee's stack. 
Importantly, blocking delegation calls are not permitted from within delegated context, and will result in a runtime assertion failure. 
In Section~\ref{s:nesting}, we describe multiple ways around this constraint.
