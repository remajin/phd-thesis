\section{Conclusion}

Synchronizing access to shared data is essential for ensuring correct behavior in multithreaded applications. 
This paper introduces \trust{}, a delegation based synchronization mechanism for safe, highly performance 
concurrent access to shared mutable state in Rust. \trust{} provides evidence that delegation can be a competitive 
alternative to locking in real systems. The programming model integrates cleanly in Rust, making delegation an 
accessible option for developers. This work lays the groundwork for additional language and runtime support to 
unlock the performance and scalability benefits of delegation-based designs.
