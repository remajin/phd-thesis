I would like to acknowledge Dr. Jakob Eriksson and Ben Baenen for their integral role in the completion of this 
dissertation.

Chapter \ref{trust} includes work done in collaboration with Dr. Jakob Eriksson, Ben Baenen and Dr. Chen Chen, 
and comes from a preprint paper in which I am the first author \cite{ahmad2024trust}. The design and 
implementation of \trust{} is a result of Dr. Eriksson's, Ben's, and my work together and Dr. Chen helped with 
experimentation and writing.

Chapter \ref{gossamer} builds on work from Chapter \ref{trust}. Dr. Eriksson helped with its writing and Dr. Chen 
helped with evaluating the system.
