\chapter*{Summary}

As workloads have grown more parallel and data-heavy, single-threaded performance has become inadequate. This gives 
rise to the problem of managing safe access to shared data. Conventionally, this is achieved through locking or 
compare and swap, both of which use atomic instructions internally. As these instructions cannot be reordered with 
other instructions, they offer limited scaling, especially as the data becomes more contented. Delegation provides 
an alternative that scales well and is not as prone to high contention. Delegation is a versatile mechanism and can 
also be used to scale an application beyond a single machine. We design and implement two systems, \trust{} and 
\name{}, to study how delegation compares against state-of-the-art systems in shared memory and distributed systems 
respectively.
