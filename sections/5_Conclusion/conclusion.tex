\section{Conclusion}

This dissertation highlights delegation as a viable alternative to locks for shared memory synchronization while 
also being applicable in a distributed setting. We introduced two system, \trust{} and \name{}, to demonstrate 
the versatility of this approach across both domains. \trust{} is a multithreaded programming framework that can 
outperform traditional locks with high contention workloads. \name{} is a distributed programming framework that 
scales well with increasing number of machines. Together, they illustrate how delegation unifies concurrency and 
distribution under a safe, efficient, and scalable programming paradigm, enabling high-performance computation 
without the complexities of shared memory or explicit synchronization.
