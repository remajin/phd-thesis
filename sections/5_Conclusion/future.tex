\section{Future Work}

Below we discuss some avenues for further research and improvements to \trust{} and \name{}.

\subsection{Better Profiling Tools}

\subsection{Better Load Balancing}
Both \trust{} and \name{} leave the distribution of data across the trustees to the programmers. While this works 
for an initial proof of concept, it complicates the application design where a change in workload distribution 
can necessitate redistribution of data. If a few trustees are busy while most are free much of the time, that 
leaves performance on the table. If this can be determined dynamically and the entrusted data be moved among 
trustees accordingly, it might result in a more performant system. On the other hand it is possible that the 
extra overhead of to doing diagnostics at runtime becomes unacceptable when all or even most of the trustees are 
busy. More research is needed to establish what the correct design in this situation is.

\subsection{Handling Network Conditions}
